This document outlines the file structure of this plugin
'Main' file: 	'da-mindbody.php'
	Purpose:	This file establishes constants and calls follow on files 
			to load the plugin's settings.
			This file acts the same as a 'main' class would in a regular
			program, thus it should only be used to call follow on tasks.

Setting File:	'da-mindbody-settings.php'
	Purpose:	This file loads all relevant files, which are required for regular 
			plugin functionality.
			Any admin specific content should be placed in the 'if (is_admin()' 
			clause. 

** FOLDERS **
'assets'		Used to store images, javascript files, css files, etc. Note that 
			files within 'assets' should generaly be loaded from functions in 
			the 'includes' folder.
	- 'custom'	Custom classes, functions and datasets. Used for things like exception
			classes.
	- 'scripts'	Used to store custom scripts for the site.

'includes'		This folder houses ALL of the plugins functionality. It has several 
			sub-folders:
	- 'admin'	Used to house any admin specific functionality!
	- 'api'		Used to house any functions or classes that rely on the api or contain
			api-specific data. I.E data that could be corrupted if there was a change
			in the MindBody API.
	- 'data'	Used to handle incoming/outgoing data between this plugin and the 
			Microservice.
	- 'module'	Used for the table display module, data processing should occur in a
			the 'data' folder. 
	- 'plugin'	Houses files that call or enqueue other files or objects for use in this
			plugin.
			
			NOTE: 	Table display and data processing are handled first by 
				'damindbody-table-control.php'
