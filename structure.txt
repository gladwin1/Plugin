This document outlines the file structure of this plugin
'Main' file: 	'da-mindbody.php'
	Purpose:	This file establishes constants and calls follow on files 
			to load the plugin's settings.
			This file acts the same as a 'main' class would in a regular
			program, thus it should only be used to call follow on tasks.

Setting File:	'da-mindbody-settings.php'
	Purpose:	This file loads all relevant files, which are required for regular 
			plugin functionality.
			Any admin specific content should be placed in the 'if (is_admin()' 
			clause. 

** FOLDERS **
'assets'		Used to store images, javascript files, css files, etc. Note that 
			files within 'assets' should generaly be loaded from functions in 
			the 'includes' folder.

'includes'		This folder houses ALL of the plugins functionality. It has several 
			sub-folders:
	- 'admin'	Used to house any admin specific functionality!
	- 'module'	Used for the table display module, data processing should occur in a
			seperate folder. TODO: DEFINE FOLDER
	- 'data'	Used to handle incoming/outgoing data between this plugin and the 
			Microservice.
			
			NOTE: 	Table display and data processing are handled first by 
				'damindbody-table-control.php'
